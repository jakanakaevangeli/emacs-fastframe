A simple tool to mitigate make-frame performance issues.

For Emacs versions 27.2 or lover, graphical frame creation can get very slow
when a lot of faces are defined. Fastframe can help mitigate this by
pre-creating a pool of invisible frames during idle time. It sets up Emacs
such that when it would normally create a new frame, it would instead choose
an existing frame from this frame pool and make it visible.

This package is not needed for Emacs versions 28 or higher, because the
frame creation performance issue was fixed. This bug is tracked in
https://debbugs.gnu.org/cgi/bugreport.cgi?bug=41200

Installation:

Add the following to your Emacs init file:

 (add-to-list 'load-path "/path/to/emacs-fastframe")
 (require 'fastframe)
 (fastframe-activate)

Notes:

- The frame pool is only used for creation of graphical frames, creation of
  tty frames is unaffected.
