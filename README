This is a simple tool to mitigate make-frame performance issues.

Graphical frame creation can get very slow when a lot of faces are defined.
Fastframe can help mitigate this by creating a pool of invisible frames
during idle time. When a frame is requested with `frame-creation-function',
a pre-made frame will be made visible from the pool and returned.

Installation:

Add the following to you Emacs init file:

 (add-to-list 'load-path "/path/to/emacs-fastframe/")
 (require 'fastframe)
 (fastframe-activate)
